[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/skipper-disk.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/skipper-disk) &nbsp; &nbsp;
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/skipper-disk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/skipper-disk)

Local filesystem adapter for receiving [upstreams](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper#what-are-upstreams). Particularly useful for streaming multipart file uploads from the [Skipper](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper) body parser.


## Installation

```
$ npm install skipper-disk --save
```

This module is part of the default configuration in [Sails](https://sailsjs.com).

> If you're using this module outside of Sails (e.g. Express or a vanilla Node.js server), make sure you have skipper itself [installed as your body parser](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/middleware?q=adding-or-overriding-http-middleware).



## Usage

> This module is bundled as the default file upload adapter in Skipper, so the following usage is slightly simpler than it is with the other Skipper file upload adapters.

In the route(s) / controller action(s) where you want to accept file uploads, do something like:

```javascript
req.file('avatar')
.upload({
  // ...options here...
},function whenDone(err, uploadedFiles) {
  if (err) return res.negotiate(err);
  else return res.ok({
    files: uploadedFiles,
    textParams: req.params.all()
  });
});
```

For more detailed usage information and a full list of available options, see the Skipper repo, especially the ["options section"](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper#options).
